Welcome to the updated LabyMod Server API repository! This API allows seamless communication between the LabyMod client and the server using simple JSON messages. It also provides the ability to enable or disable specific LabyMod features.

To get started with the API, refer to the [API documentation](https://docs.labymod.net/pages/server/introduction/) for detailed information on how it works.

This repository has been forked by Splatcrafter and updated to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Spigot/Bukkit, Bungeecord, and Velocity.

## Installation

### Spigot/Bukkit

1. Download the latest version of the plugin from the Releases tab.
2. Place the plugin in your server's `plugins` folder.
3. Start your server.

### Bungeecord

1. Download the latest version of the plugin from the Releases tab.
2. Place the plugin in your Bungeecord's `plugins` folder.
3. Start your Bungeecord server.

### Velocity

1. Download the latest version of the plugin from the Releases tab.
2. Place the plugin in your Velocity's `plugins` folder.
3. Start your Velocity server.

## Usage

### Spigot/Bukkit

The plugin will automatically start when you launch your Spigot/Bukkit server. It acts as the Client-Server-Communication-Plugin and handles communication between the LabyMod client and the server.

### Bungeecord

The plugin will automatically start when you launch your Bungeecord server. This component serves as the Bungeecord integration and enables interaction with the proxy.

### Velocity

The plugin will automatically start when you launch your Velocity server. This component serves as the Velocity integration and enables interaction with the proxy.
